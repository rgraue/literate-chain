# Learning

- local pinecone development (pretty cool. getting the image behind proxy sucks)
- config pinecone to work with embedding models (dimension)
- pinecone just gives back relevant vectors to the query vectors. you still have to do the acting with these vectors.
- node may not be the langauge for this...
- pinecone assistant. basically does all this for you. but can't run one locally :/
